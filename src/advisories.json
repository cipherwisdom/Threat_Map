      "shortDescription": "The Zergeca botnet, written in Golang, is a sophisticated threat capable of various malicious activities, including DDoS attacks, proxying, scanning, self-upgrading, persistence, file transfer, reverse shell, and data collection. It employs DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) and the Smux library for secure C2 communications.",
      "fullDescription": "The Zergeca botnet, written in Golang, is a sophisticated threat capable of various malicious activities, including DDoS attacks, proxying, scanning, self-upgrading, persistence, file transfer, reverse shell, and data collection. It employs DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) and the Smux library for secure C2 communications. The botnet is linked to the IP address 84.54.51[.]82, previously associated with the Mirai botnet, suggesting that experienced threat actors are behind it. Zergeca has notably targeted Canada, Germany, and the U.S. with ACK flood DDoS attacks between early and mid-June 2024. Zergeca's functionality is divided into four modules: persistence, proxy, silivaccine, and zombie. These modules enable the botnet to establish persistence, implement proxying, remove competing malware, and report sensitive information to its C2 server while supporting various DDoS attacks and other malicious activities. The use of advanced evasion tactics, such as modified UPX packing and XOR encryption, along with its multi-functional capabilities, makes Zergeca a significant and evolving cyber threat.",

This group has carried out several successful attacks in the past two weeks, locking both Windows, Linux workstations and servers by exploiting common administrative credentials. The attacker first exfiltrates data to C2 servers, following which the files are encrypted with a “.nba” file extension. The attack vector includes common administrative credentials harvested from the network. The threat actor features no leak site and instead uses threatening phone calls to leadership and IT executives to demand payment.",
